I'm a 4th year Computer Science & Business Double Degree student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).

I'm currently an undergraduate research assistant under the supervision of Professor Gautam Kamath. Previously I was a machine learning research intern at Uber Advanced Technologies Group supervised by Professor Raquel Urtasun. I also have experience as a software engineering intern at Wish and a quantitative analyst at BMO Capital Markets. 


Aside from mathematics and computer science, I invest my time in basketball, track & field, weightlifting, chess, drawing, reading and poker.
